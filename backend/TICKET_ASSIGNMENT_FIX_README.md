# Ticket Assignment Fix - README

## Problem Description

Tickets were showing "Unassigned" status because the ticket assignment system was failing. The root cause was a **database schema mismatch**:

### Issues Found:
1. **Wrong Table Query**: The ticket assignment system was querying the `agents` table instead of the `users` table
2. **Foreign Key Mismatch**: The `tickets` table has `assigned_to` column that references `users(id)`, not `agents(id)`
3. **Role Value Inconsistency**: Different role values between tables
4. **No Active Agents Found**: The system couldn't find support executives for assignment

### Database Structure:
- **`users` table**: Contains support executives with role `support_executive` (IDs 13, 14, 55, 56, 63)
- **`agents` table**: Contains only 3 agents with different role values
- **`tickets` table**: `assigned_to` column references `users(id)` via foreign key

## Solution Implemented

**Option 1: Fix the Ticket Assignment System** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

Updated the ticket assignment system to query the correct table:

### Files Modified:
- `tick/backend/utils/ticketAssignment.js`

### Changes Made:

#### 1. `getAgentWithLeastTickets()` Method
```sql
-- BEFORE (WRONG):
FROM agents a
WHERE a.is_active = TRUE AND a.role = 'support_executive'

-- AFTER (FIXED):
FROM users u
WHERE u.is_active = TRUE AND u.role = 'support_executive'
```

#### 2. `getAssignmentStatistics()` Method
```sql
-- BEFORE (WRONG):
FROM agents a
WHERE a.is_active = TRUE

-- AFTER (FIXED):
FROM users u
WHERE u.is_active = TRUE AND u.role = 'support_executive'
```

#### 3. Fixed Bug in Statistics Query
- Corrected the `closed_tickets` JOIN that was incorrectly referencing `in_progress_tickets`

## Testing Results

### âœ… Before Fix:
- Ticket assignment failed with "No active agents available for ticket assignment"
- All tickets showed "Unassigned" status
- System couldn't find support executives

### âœ… After Fix:
- Ticket assignment works correctly
- Support executives are found in the `users` table
- Tickets get assigned automatically using equal distribution
- Rebalancing function works properly

### Test Results:
```bash
ðŸŽ¯ Selected support executive for assignment: Support Executive 1 (ID: 13) with 0 active tickets
âœ… Ticket 23 assigned to Support Executive 1 (ID: 13) using equal distribution

ðŸ”„ Starting ticket assignment rebalancing...
ðŸ“‹ Found 1 unassigned tickets to rebalance
ðŸŽ¯ Selected support executive for assignment: Support Executive 2 (ID: 14) with 0 active tickets
âœ… Ticket 24 assigned to Support Executive 2 (ID: 14) using equal distribution
âœ… Rebalancing completed: 1 tickets reassigned
```

## Current Status

**âœ… RESOLVED**: Ticket assignment system is now working correctly

- New tickets will be automatically assigned to support executives
- Equal distribution algorithm works properly
- Support executives are found in the correct table
- Foreign key relationships are maintained

## Support Executives Available

The system now correctly identifies these support executives:
- **ID 13**: Support Executive 1 (executive1@company.com)
- **ID 14**: Support Executive 2 (executive2@company.com)  
- **ID 55**: leo (STAFF944841APW)
- **ID 56**: sri (sri589)
- **ID 63**: sri (sri747)

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Watch for new tickets to ensure they get assigned automatically
2. **Test**: Create new tickets to verify the fix works in production
3. **Consider**: Future cleanup of the `agents` table if it's no longer needed

## Files Modified
