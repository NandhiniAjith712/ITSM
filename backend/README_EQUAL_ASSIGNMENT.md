# 🎯 Equal Ticket Assignment System

## Overview

The Equal Ticket Assignment System automatically distributes tickets among all active agents to ensure fair workload distribution. When a new ticket is created, it's automatically assigned to the agent with the least number of active tickets.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Automatic Equal Distribution
- **Smart Assignment**: New tickets are automatically assigned to the agent with the least active tickets
- **Fair Workload**: Ensures all agents have balanced workloads
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically includes new agents when they're added
- **Real-time Stats**: Monitor workload distribution in real-time

### ✅ Key Benefits
- **No Manual Assignment**: Tickets are assigned automatically upon creation
- **Balanced Workload**: Prevents any single agent from being overwhelmed
- **Scalable**: Works with any number of agents
- **Transparent**: Clear statistics and assignment tracking

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Agent Selection Algorithm
```javascript
// Gets the agent with the least number of active tickets
const agent = await TicketAssignmentService.getAgentWithLeastTickets();
```

**Selection Criteria:**
- Only active agents (`is_active = TRUE`)
- Counts only `new` and `in_progress` tickets
- Orders by ticket count (ascending), then by agent ID (ascending)

### 2. Automatic Assignment Process
```javascript
// Automatically assigns ticket to agent with least tickets
const result = await TicketAssignmentService.assignTicketEqually(ticketId, assignedBy);
```

**Assignment Steps:**
1. Find agent with least active tickets
2. Update ticket with selected agent
3. Log assignment in `ticket_assignments` table
4. Return assignment details

### 3. Statistics and Monitoring
```javascript
// Get comprehensive assignment statistics
const stats = await TicketAssignmentService.getAssignmentStatistics();
```

**Statistics Include:**
- New tickets per agent
- In-progress tickets per agent
- Closed tickets per agent
- Total tickets per agent
- Average tickets per agent

## 📊 API Endpoints

### GET `/api/tickets/assignment-stats`
Get comprehensive assignment statistics for all agents.

**Response:**
```json

    "agents": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "admin",
        "email": "admin@company.com",
        "role": "support_executive",
        "department": "Support",
        "is_active": true,
        "new_tickets": 2,
        "in_progress_tickets": 1,
        "closed_tickets": 5,
        "total_tickets": 8
      }
    ],
    "total_agents": 2,
    "total_tickets": 15,
    "average_tickets_per_agent": "7.50"
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/tickets/rebalance`
Rebalance all unassigned tickets among agents.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Rebalancing completed: 3 tickets reassigned",
  "data": {
    "rebalanced_tickets": 3,
    "total_unassigned": 3
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/tickets/:id/assign-equally`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "assigned_by": 1
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Ticket assigned to admin using equal distribution",
  "data": {
    "ticket_id": 123,
    "assigned_to": 1,
    "assigned_to_name": "admin",

    "assignment_method": "equal_distribution",
    "active_tickets_count": 3
  }
}
```

## 🎨 Frontend Component

### TicketAssignmentStats Component
A React component that displays:
- Assignment statistics overview
- Agent workload distribution
- Rebalancing controls
- System information

**Usage:**
```jsx
import TicketAssignmentStats from './components/TicketAssignmentStats';

// In your component
<TicketAssignmentStats />
```

## 🔄 Integration

### Automatic Assignment on Ticket Creation
The system is automatically integrated into the ticket creation process:

```javascript
// In backend/routes/tickets.js
// After ticket creation
const assignmentResult = await TicketAssignmentService.assignTicketEqually(ticketId, userId);
```

### Manual Assignment Override
Agents can still be manually assigned tickets, but the system will continue to use equal distribution for new tickets.

## 📈 Monitoring and Analytics

### Assignment Tracking
All assignments are logged in the `ticket_assignments` table:
- `ticket_id`: The assigned ticket
- `agent_id`: The assigned agent
- `assigned_by`: Who made the assignment
- `assigned_at`: When the assignment was made
- `assignment_reason`: Reason for assignment (e.g., "Automatic equal distribution assignment")

### Performance Metrics
- **Equal Distribution**: Ensures tickets are distributed evenly
- **Response Time**: Agents with fewer tickets respond faster
- **Workload Balance**: Prevents agent burnout
- **Scalability**: Works with any number of agents

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Agent Requirements
- Must be `is_active = TRUE`
- Must have valid `name` and `email`
- Can have any `role` (support_executive, support_manager, admin)

### Ticket Requirements
- Must have valid `status` (new, in_progress, closed, escalated)
- Can be assigned to any active agent

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Agents Found**
   - Ensure agents exist in the database
   - Check that agents are `is_active = TRUE`

2. **Assignment Fails**
   - Verify `assigned_to` and `assigned_by` columns exist
   - Check foreign key constraints

3. **Statistics Not Updating**
   - Refresh the statistics page
   - Check database connectivity

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test the equal assignment system
node test-equal-assignment.js

# Check assignment statistics
curl http://localhost:5000/api/tickets/assignment-stats

# Rebalance assignments
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/tickets/rebalance
```
