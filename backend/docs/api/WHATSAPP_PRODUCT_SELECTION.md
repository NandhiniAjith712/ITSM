# 📱 WhatsApp Product Selection Feature

## 🎯 Overview

The WhatsApp integration now includes an **interactive product selection** feature that allows users to choose from available products in your database, just like in the web form. Users can see all active products with their descriptions and SLA times, and simply click to select.

## ✨ Features

### **📦 Interactive Product List**
- **Dynamic Product Loading**: Fetches products directly from your `products` table
- **Product Information**: Shows product name, description, and SLA time
- **Click-to-Select**: Users simply tap on a product to select it
- **Real-time Updates**: Always shows the latest products from your database

### **🔄 Enhanced Conversation Flow**
The WhatsApp conversation now follows this improved flow:

1. **Name** → User enters full name
2. **Email** → User enters email address  
3. **Country** → User selects country from list
4. **Mobile** → User enters mobile number
5. **📦 Product** → **NEW!** User selects product from interactive list
6. **Issue Title** → User enters issue title
7. **Issue Type** → User selects issue type from list
8. **Description** → User describes the issue
9. **✅ Ticket Created** → System creates ticket with product information

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Database Integration**
```sql
-- Products are fetched from the products table
SELECT id, name, description, sla_time_minutes, priority_level 
FROM products 
WHERE status = 'active' 
ORDER BY name ASC
```

### **WhatsApp Interactive Message Structure**
```javascript
{
  type: 'interactive',
  interactive: {
    type: 'list',
    body: {
      text: 'Select your product:'
    },
    action: {
      button: 'Choose Product',
      sections: [{
        title: 'Available Products',
        rows: [
          {
            id: 'product_28',
            title: '📦 Email System', // Max 24 characters
            description: 'Email management and communication system | SLA: 30 min'
          },
          // ... more products
        ]
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Character Limit Handling**
WhatsApp has a **24-character limit** for row titles. Long product names are automatically truncated:
- **Original**: "GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance)"
- **WhatsApp**: "📦 GRC (Governance, ..." (23 chars)
- **Original**: "VOC (Voice of Customer)"
- **WhatsApp**: "📦 VOC (Voice of Cus..." (23 chars)

The full product name is still stored in the database and shown in the description.

### **Product Selection Handling**
```javascript
// When user selects a product
case conversationStates.ASKING_PRODUCT:
  const productId = userMessage.trim(); // e.g., "product_28"
  
  if (productId.startsWith('product_')) {
    const productIdNumber = productId.replace('product_', '');
    const products = await getProductsForWhatsApp();
    const selectedProduct = products.find(p => p.id.toString() === productIdNumber);
    
    if (selectedProduct) {
      conversation.data.product = selectedProduct.name;
      conversation.data.productId = selectedProduct.id;
      // Proceed to next step
    }
  }
```

## 📊 Product Information Display

### **Product List Format**
Each product in the WhatsApp list shows:
- **📦 Product Name** (e.g., "Email System")
- **Description** (e.g., "Email management and communication system")
- **SLA Time** (e.g., "SLA: 30 min")

### **Example Product Display**
```
📦 Email System
Email management and communication system | SLA: 30 min

📦 Financial Management  
Financial reporting and management system | SLA: 120 min

📦 GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance)
Governance, risk management, and compliance platform | SLA: 240 min
```
